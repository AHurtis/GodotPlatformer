# GodotPlatformer
A personal project to make a 2D platformer with Godot engine.
The ultimate goal of the project is to create at least 10 minutes worth of content.
In essence the project will end up looking like 'demo' build that showcases the mechanics and featues of the game.
At the time of writing there is no thematic/aesthetic vision for this project; artistic fidelity is not a high priority.
The main priority is to prepare a functional game world where the player can explore the game space. Art assets may be implemented once the game has achieved a desired build.
The reasoning behind this order of operation is that it will be more effecient to create working code, logic, and placeholder assets firsthand. Artwork is highly subject to changes and iterations; more of that time could be better spent studying how to work with Godot and creating legible, functional code within the engine.
