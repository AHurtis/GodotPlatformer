# GodotPlatformer
This is a personal project which makes use of Godot Engine and its in-house language: GDscript, which uses syntax similar to Python.
The ultimate goal of the project is to create a 2D platformer with 8 to 10 minutes of content. This metric of time is arbitrary and may be subject to change.
In essence, the project will end up looking like a 'demo build' that showcases the game world.
At the time of writing there is no thematic/aesthetic vision for this project; artistic fidelity is not a high priority.
The main priority is to prepare a functional game world where the player can explore the game space. Art assets may be implemented at a later time in the project's life.
The reasoning behind this order of operation is that it will be more effecient to create working code, logic, and placeholder assets firsthand. Artwork is highly subject to changes and iterations; more of that time is better spent studying how to work with Godot and creating legible, functional code within the engine.
At its core, this will be a traditional platformer with side-scrolling, simple hitboxes for enemies and collectibles/points.
